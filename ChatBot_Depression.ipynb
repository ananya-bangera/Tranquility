            "There have been some recent changes to the classification of anxiety disorders. Consistent with the previous version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV 9 ), DSM-5 10 includes the following anxiety disorders: specific phobia, generalised anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder (formerly social phobia), panic disorder and agoraphobia. Key changes in DSM-5 include: (i) agoraphobia has been classified as a stand-alone diagnosis (ie, no longer linked to the presence or absence of panic disorder), (ii) separation anxiety disorder and selective mutism have been re-classified as anxiety disorders (rather than in a section for ‘disorders usually first diagnosed in infancy, childhood or adolescence’) and (iii) obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder are, respectively, grouped under obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, and trauma-related and stressor-related disorders (ie, no longer included within the anxiety disorders category). i While core features of each anxiety disorder are broadly consistent with DSM-IV, in order to minimise the over-diagnosis of transient fears for agoraphobia, specific phobia and social anxiety disorder, those under the age of 18 are now required to have had symptoms for at least 6 months.\n",
            "\n",
            "Anxiety disorders are among the most common psychiatric conditions in young people, with community studies indicating a period prevalence between 9% and 32% during childhood and adolescence. 1 They typically have an adverse impact on educational achievement, family life and leisure activities 2 , 3 ; and they often co-occur with other anxiety disorders, depression and behavioural disorders. 4 Anxiety disorders in young people are associated with increased rates of anxiety and depression in early adulthood, as well as with a number of other adverse mental health and life course outcomes. 5 , 6 Indeed, for the majority of adults with anxiety disorders and depression the onset of psychological difficulties was in childhood or adolescence, with anxiety disorders being the most common prior diagnosis. 7 Despite the significant public health burden associated with anxiety disorders in children and young people, they commonly remain untreated. 8 Collectively these considerations highlight the importance of early access to effective identification and treatment.\n",
            "\n",
            "Young people with anxiety disorders are unlikely to present for help independently, with parents commonly raising concerns to general practitioners. The challenge in assessing for the presence of anxiety disorders is distinguishing pathology from ‘normal’ developmentally appropriate fears and worries. As anxiety disorders represent an extreme presentation of normal events, this distinction is essentially made on the basis of the severity and persistence of symptoms and the degree of associated impairment. Structured interview schedules used for assessing the presence of anxiety disorders typically establish whether a child meets symptom criteria for a specific anxiety diagnosis, as well as the degree to which these symptoms interfere with functioning. The most widely used diagnostic schedule is the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for children and parents (ADIS-C/P 18 ) which follows DSM-IV criteria. Questionnaire measures with normative data also provide a useful indication of whether symptoms are present at a clinical level. While there are no brief screening measures for use with children and young people, parent and child report measures such as the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS 19 ) and the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS 20 ) contain scales that broadly align with diagnostic categories. These tools are valuable in helping to identify clinical levels of anxiety among young people (as diagnostic cut-offs are available) and they can be useful in monitoring progress through treatment. Although National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines relating to anxiety disorders principally relate to adults, the recent NICE guideline for the assessment and treatment of social anxiety disorder 21 highlights a number of considerations for assessment with young people which can be applied across the anxiety disorders. It is noted, in particular, that once potential concerns relating to anxiety have been identified in a young person, a comprehensive assessment should be conducted by an appropriate healthcare professional. This should include an opportunity for interviewing the young person on their own; and it should also involve interviewing a parent, carer or other adult who knows the child well and can report on current and past behaviour. Since there is a high level of comorbidity in young people with anxiety disorders, it is essential to assess for possible co-existing mental health problems, neurodevelopmental conditions, drug and alcohol misuse, and speech and language problems.\n",

            "\n",
            "The most commonly evaluated treatments for anxiety disorders in children and adolescence are psychological approaches, especially cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). One of the first manualised CBT programmes for the treatment of anxiety disorders in young people was Kendall's ‘Coping Cat’.22 This includes components concerned with psycho-education, identification and modification of negative automatic thoughts, exposure to feared stimuli, problem solving, and training in coping skills. Most programmes subsequently developed are heavily influenced by ‘Coping Cat’.\n",
            "\n",
            "The great majority of young people with anxiety disorders do not access clinical services.23 This is likely to be the result of a lack of awareness and knowledge, lack of appropriate local services, long waiting lists for treatment, competing family time commitments and a paucity of trained professionals. In line with guidance for increasing access to treatment in adult populations,24 recent therapeutic innovations have focused on brief or low-intensity versions of CBT that can be delivered by non-specialists, with the ultimate aim of delivering treatment within a stepped-care framework. The logic here is to deliver brief, relatively simple, first-line treatments routinely to service users with a relatively good prognosis, reserving more intensive treatments for those who do not respond to the first-line treatment and those whose prognostic profile indicates that they require more input.25\n",
            "\n",
            "Low-intensity interventions for anxiety disorders in childhood and adolescence Two low-intensity approaches have been subjected to systematic evaluation: (i) brief treatments in which parents are guided to work through a book that instructs them on how to help their child overcome their difficulties with anxiety (‘bibliotherapy’) and (ii) treatments delivered via computerised platforms (‘e-therapies’). Bibliotherapy Promising evidence is emerging of impressive clinical gains using low-intensity CBT for child anxiety delivered by parents. Notably, in an Australian study, the simple provision of a workbook for parents was associated with recovery in 26% of anxious children aged 6–12 years, compared to 7% who received no treatment.26 The addition of therapist support, however, has been found to be associated with substantially higher recovery rates. Lyneham and Rapee,27 for example, in a study of the treatment of childhood anxiety in a rural Australian population, supplemented a workbook for parents with nine scheduled weekly phone calls or emails. Almost 90% of children no longer met diagnostic criteria for their primary anxiety disorder following treatment, and gains were maintained at a 12-month follow-up. Notably, in a further Australian study of the treatment of anxious children, no difference in child outcome was found between bibliotherapy delivered via parents (supported by a 2-h group plus regular phone calls) compared to outcome following twelve 60–90 min sessions of CBT delivered with parents and children.28 A similar approach has recently been applied with a referred population from a UK National Health Service setting.29 A sample of anxious children (of non-anxious mothers) received an intervention where parents were given a CBT manual30 and 5 h 20 min contact (face-to-face sessions and telephone reviews) with a therapist to help them apply the manual's principles. Immediately following the intervention 50% of children were free of their primary diagnosis (double the rate in the waitlist control group), increasing to over 70% at 6-month follow-up. Notably, in this study, level of therapist experience was unrelated to child outcome, suggesting that this low-intensity approach can be delivered effectively by novice therapists. Together these studies suggest that therapist guided bibliotherapy, delivered via parents, is an effective and efficient treatment for child anxiety. E-therapies Two computerised treatment programmes for childhood anxiety disorders have been developed and systematically evaluated: BRAVE for Children-Online31 and Camp-Cope-A-Lot: The Coping Cat.32 Both programmes involve the child completing 10–12 computerised CBT sessions, with some additional sessions for parents. Sessions are therapist-supported. In BRAVE for Children-Online, the therapist provides weekly personalised emails and one telephone call to help the child plan their exposure hierarchy. In Camp-Cope-A-Lot, the therapist is present for six sessions and assists in implementing exposure tasks. In studies of both approaches computerised treatment was superior to the waitlist and received high patient satisfaction ratings. March et al31 found that 30% of the children who received BRAVE for Children-Online were free of their primary diagnosis immediately post-treatment; however, few children had completed all therapy sessions. By 6-month follow-up, when 62% of children had completed all sessions, 75% of recruited participants were free of their primary diagnosis. Khanna and Kendall32 found Camp-Cope-A-Lot to be as effective as face-to-face CBT; 81% were free of their primary diagnosis at post-treatment with progress maintained at 3-month follow-up. Three computerised treatments designed specifically for anxious adolescents have been evaluated: BRAVE for Teenagers-Online,33 Cool Teens34 and Think, Feel Do.35 Spence et al33 compared BRAVE for Teenagers-Online to individual, clinic-based CBT and found no differences between groups post-treatment and at follow-up assessments. By the 12-month follow-up, 68% of those who received the online treatment were free of their primary anxiety disorder diagnosis. In Cool Teens, the adolescent undertakes 12 sessions via a CD-ROM, with parent support and regular telephone calls from a therapist. Wuthrich et al34 compared Cool Teens with a waitlist and found similar end of treatment results to the Spence et al33; however, in contrast to Spence, there was deterioration by the 3-month follow-up. Finally, encouraging preliminary findings have been obtained using the Think, Feel, Do programme in relation to symptoms of social anxiety.35 Taken together, these studies suggest that e-therapies may be a promising low-intensity approach for the treatment of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents.\n",
            "\n",
            "High-intensity interventions for anxiety disorders in childhood and adolescence More intensive treatments for childhood anxiety, typically involving 9–20 face-to-face CBT treatment sessions, have been subjected to extensive evaluation. In a Cochrane review, James et al36 identified 41 systematic evaluations of CBT with children and young people with anxiety disorders aged above four and below 19 years of age. The odds ratio (OR) for remission across these studies was 0.13 for CBT versus waiting list controls, with CBT effective in over 59% of cases compared to 18.4% in controls. Method of treatment delivery (ie, individually with the child, in a group, or with parents/the family) was not systematically related to outcome. Notably, eight of these studies included an active therapeutic comparison condition (eg, educational support) and, collectively, these studies did not show superior outcomes for those receiving CBT. While one could not, therefore, conclude from the current evidence base that CBT is the most effective form of treatment, it is the only treatment with an adequate evidence base to support its general application. The majority of randomised controlled trials to evaluate CBT for anxiety disorders in young people have included children over 7 years of age. The extent to which CBT is applicable to younger children has been debated. It has been questioned whether young children have the cognitive capacities to benefit from the cognitive components of treatment; and it has been noted that the modification of young children's behaviour is heavily reliant on parental influences. Nevertheless, some positive findings have been reported with young children. Hirshfeld-Becker et al37 demonstrated the effectiveness of a parent and child programme for the treatment of 4–7-year-old children with an anxiety disorder, as did Waters, Ford, Wharton and Cobham38 with 4–8-year-old children. In the latter study similar outcomes were found whether the treatment was delivered with parents and children or with parents alone. A group CBT programme delivered solely to parents has also been shown to be effective for 2–9-year-old children with anxiety disorders.39 The studies described above have typically included children with a range of anxiety disorders. This is partly driven by theoretical considerations, in that there are no well-validated diagnosis-specific models of the maintenance of disorder in children and young people; and partly for practical reasons, in that there is such a high level of comorbidity between the anxiety disorders.40 There has been some recent suggestion, however, that disorder-specific treatments may be associated with better outcomes for some disorders, especially social anxiety disorder. Indeed, a number of recent reports have noted that children and young people with social anxiety disorder do not make as substantial gains from generic treatment as those with other anxiety disorders.41–43 Correspondingly, recent meta-analyses have revealed better outcomes for young people with social anxiety disorder following disorder-specific compared to generic treatments.11 ,44 These ‘specific’ treatments have typically included the addition to generic treatments of social skills training and opportunities for peer interactions. There has been some interest in specific treatments for other conditions, such as specific phobias45 and separation anxiety disorder.46 For separation anxiety disorder no clear advantage over generic treatments has emerged to date.46 For specific phobias, direct comparisons with generic treatments have not been conducted; however, some evidence suggests that taking an especially focused approach may allow for particularly rapid treatment. Thus, brief exposure-based treatment has been found to be effective compared to an active (education support) control, with 55% of children being free of their specific phobia after a single treatment session.45\n",
            "\n",
            "Considerations for good practice in the delivery of psychological interventions for children and young people with anxiety disorders The recent NICE guidelines for the assessment and treatment of social anxiety disorder21 set out treatment principles for working with children and young people that apply well across the anxiety disorders. Specifically, it is noted that all interventions should be delivered by competent practitioners who receive regular, high-quality supervision that is informed by routine monitoring of treatment progress from each treatment session. The content of treatment should be based on relevant evidence-based treatment manuals, and adherence to these manuals should be monitored and evaluated in supervision, for example, using video or audio recordings of treatment sessions. Therapists should be aware of the potential impact of the child's home, school and wider social environment on the maintenance and treatment of anxiety disorders, so should work with the child or young person's parents, teachers or peers, as appropriate, to create an environment that supports the goals of treatment.\n",
            "This study adds to previous research by showing that both medium and high levels of anxiety symptoms are strongly associated with poor overall HRQoL. While most adolescents with low overall anxiety symptoms reported normal HRQoL, indicated by mean KINDL-R scores above the “healthy” cut-off of 70, adolescents with medium and high anxiety symptoms reported significantly poorer HRQoL. Our findings are in line with previous studies that investigated the association between HRQoL and anxiety symptoms among adolescents in community samples [32, 33] and in adolescents with anxiety disorders [15, 34, 35]. Also in line with previous studies, we found that female gender, higher age, lower perceived family economic status and reported negative life events were significantly associated with lower HRQoL and elevated levels of anxiety symptoms [24, 26]. Contrary to previous studies, ethnicity was not significantly associated with elevated anxiety symptoms or HRQoL impairment, probably due to of the small number of Non-Western immigrants participating in our sample.\n",
            "\n",
            "Importantly, although the adolescents in our sample were recruited from a community sample and not from a help-seeking sample, elevated levels of anxiety symptoms were strongly associated with poor HRQoL. The mean level of overall HRQoL reported by adolescents with medium anxiety symptoms in our sample (KINDL-R total score M = 63) was similar to overall HRQoL reported by OCD-diagnosed, treatment-seeking Scandinavian adolescents [15]. The HRQoL impairment in adolescents with high overall anxiety symptoms in our sample (M = 56) was similar to HRQoL impairment reported by youth with bipolar disorder (M = 53) [16].\n",
            "\n",
            "In health policies, the level of disability associated with a certain health problem, in this case anxiety, can be used to compare the need for investments in health services and initiatives across problem areas [23]. “Burden of disease-measurements” in developed countries report anxiety disorders as number four among the problems that cause disability [10, 11]. The results from the current study imply that adolescents with anxiety problems also report decreased HRQoL, and add to the existing literature on anxiety and HRQoL which previously primarily have been studied in adolescents with anxiety disorders. And importantly, our results add to the picture based on adolescents’ subjective reports.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall elevated anxiety symptom levels were associated with impairment in all HRQoL dimensions. Surprisingly however, highly anxious adolescents reported relatively high scores in the family HRQoL dimension. The finding that anxious adolescents report poor HRQoL in the school and friend dimensions and not so much in the family dimension, is in line with a previous study [15] and could have practical implications for identifying anxious adolescents. Parents are usually central in identifying problems and seeking appropriate mental health interventions for adolescents [52]. However, if the parent doesn’t witness situations in which the adolescent is impaired by anxiety symptoms, recognizing anxiety as problematic for the adolescent might be difficult. Instead, teachers are more likely to be present in these situations, suggesting that teachers are key to identifying the adolescent’s anxiety and facilitating appropriate interventions. Furthermore, since the main concern for anxious adolescents seems to be school more than family-related, early interventions targeted at anxious adolescents should consider including standard sessions for teachers and not sessions for adolescents and parents exclusively.\n",
            "\n",
            "In health policies, the level of disability associated with a certain health problem, HRQoL impairment can be used to compare the need for investments in health services and initiatives across problem areas. “Burden of disease-measurement” in developed countries, report anxiety disorders as number four among the problems that cause disability in adolescence [11, 53]. Our findings elaborate the importance of interventions and initiatives targeting anxious adolescents on the basis of subjective experiences reported by adolescents themselves. Further studies should investigate the benefits and potential side effects of programs designed to increase identification and improve early interventions for anxious adolescents [54,55,56]. Building on public health approach underscoring preventions and early interventions [36,37,38,39], we argue that addressing anxiety is not only the responsibility of the individual adolescents and their families, but also of schools, school health services and policy makers.\n",

            "Limitations and strengths\n",
            "\n",
            "This study has several limitations. The cross-sectional study design did not allow for conclusions about the directionality of the associations between study variables. Also the one measure point design is not ideal for conclusions about the duration of anxiety problems. Hence, the proportion of the anxious adolescents that has anxiety as a state, e.g. as a 1 day problem, is unknown. The sole use of self-report measures might also have led to a common method bias [57]. Further, family economy should be measured by other indicators than by the adolescent’s perceptions [58]. Also, in lack of Norwegian norms for the SCAS, Australian norms were applied. The mean total SCAS score for adolescent girls and boys in another Scandinavian culture (Denmark) has been found to be lower than in the Australian norm sample [59]. If the Danish norms had been used instead for Australian, more adolescents had been categorized with elevated anxiety level. Since the Danish norms were still not available on the official website for the SCAS when our analyses were run, we decided to use the Australian norms. However, for conclusions about the associations between variables and not primarily for estimating prevalence, the chosen cut-offs were not considered as a major concern. Further, the analysis was limited to anxiety problems and quality of life, and other problems that could influence the relationship between these variables were not included. There are some concerns regarding the representativeness of the study sample. Participants were recruited from three of five regions of Norway (East, South and West). The Midst and Northern regions were not included, due to practical considerations (travel distances, costs). The participating counties were situated in rural and sub-rural parts of Norway; none of them were big cities. Also, the schools were chosen on the basis that they agreed to participate in a school-based intervention study for anxious adolescents. Schools and individuals who volunteered may possess different characteristics than the population as whole, and the problem of self-selection bias may be present [60]. The reasons for the low response rate may be scepticism on the part of the parents and low priority of mental health surveys for their adolescents, in addition to technical challenges with the electronic system for collecting informed consent. Previous research has found that active parental consent lead to parental permission and response rates in the range of 30–60% for students, biased toward excluding minorities, students having problems in school, or students at risk of mental health problems [61]. However, despite these concerns, findings from our sample parallel those obtained from other epidemiological studies in adolescents attending lower secondary schools in Norway [62].\n",
            "\n",

Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) Developed in 1959, the Hamilton test was one of the first rating scales for anxiety. It’s still widely used in clinical and research settings. It involves 14 questions that rate moods, fears, and tension, as well as physical, mental, and behavioral traits. A professional must administer the Hamilton test. Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) The BAI helps measure the severity of your anxiety. You can take the test by yourself. It may also be given orally by a professional or paraprofessional. There are 21 multiple-choice questions that ask you to rate your experience of symptoms during the past week. These symptoms include tingling, numbness, and fear. Answer options include “not at all,” “mildly,” “moderately,” or “severely.” Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN) This 17-question self-assessment measures your level of social phobia. You rate your anxiety in relation to various social situations on a scale from zero to four. Zero indicates no anxiety. Four indicates extreme anxiety. Penn State Worry Questionnaire This test is the most widely used measure of worry. It distinguishes between social anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. The test uses 16 questions to measure your worry’s generality, excessiveness, and uncontrollability. Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale This seven-question test is a screening tool for generalized anxiety disorder. You’re asked how often in the past two weeks you’ve been bothered by feelings of irritability, nervousness, or fear. Options include “not at all,” “several days,” “more than half the days,” or “nearly every day.” Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) The YBOCS is used to measure levels of OCD. It’s conducted as a one-on-one interview between you and a mental health professional. You choose three items from a symptom checklist that are the most disturbing and then rate how severe they are. Then, you’re asked whether you’ve had certain other obsessions or compulsions in the past. Based on your answers, the mental health professional grades your OCD as subclinical, mild, moderate, severe, or extreme.\n",

However, an anxiety disorder can make it difficult or impossible for a child to cope. The same diagnostic criteria and assessments that are used for adults apply to children, too. In the Anxiety and Related Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-5 (ADIS-5), your doctor interviews both you and your child about their symptoms. Symptoms in children are similar to those in adults. If you notice anxiety symptoms or any anxious or worrying behaviors that last for more than two weeks, take your child to the doctor. There, they can be checked for an anxiety disorder. Some research suggests that anxiety can have a genetic component. If anyone in your family has ever been diagnosed with anxiety or a depressive disorder, get your child evaluated as soon as you notice symptoms. A proper diagnosis can lead to interventions to help them manage anxiety at a young age.\n",

            "['Depression\\n\\nWhat Is Depression?', 'Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act.', 'Fortunately, it is also treatable.', 'Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed.', 'It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease your ability to function at work and at home.', 'Depression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:\\n\\nFeeling sad or having a depressed mood\\n\\nLoss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed\\n\\nChanges in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting\\n\\nTrouble sleeping or sleeping too much\\n\\nLoss of energy or increased fatigue\\n\\nIncrease in purposeless physical activity (e.g., inability to sit still, pacing, handwringing) or slowed movements or speech (these actions must be severe enough to be observable by others)\\n\\nFeeling worthless or guilty\\n\\nDifficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions\\n\\nThoughts of death or suicide\\n\\nSymptoms must last at least two weeks and must represent a change in your previous level of functioning for a diagnosis of depression.', 'Also, medical conditions (e.g., thyroid problems, a brain tumor or vitamin deficiency) can mimic symptoms of depression so it is important to rule out general medical causes.', 'Depression affects an estimated one in 15 adults (6.7%) in any given year.', 'And one in six people (16.6%) will experience depression at some time in their life.', 'Depression can occur at any time, but on average, first appears during the late teens to mid-20s.', 'Women are more likely than men to experience depression.', 'Some studies show that one-third of women will experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime.', 'There is a high degree of heritability (approximately 40%) when first-degree relatives (parents/children/siblings) have depression.', 'Depression Is Different From Sadness or Grief/Bereavement\\n\\nThe death of a loved one, loss of a job or the ending of a relationship are difficult experiences for a person to endure.', 'It is normal for feelings of sadness or grief to develop in response to such situations.', 'Those experiencing loss often might describe themselves as being “depressed.”\\n\\nBut being sad is not the same as having depression.', 'The grieving process is natural and unique to each individual and shares some of the same features of depression.', 'Both grief and depression may involve intense sadness and withdrawal from usual activities.', 'They are also different in important ways:\\n\\nIn grief, painful feelings come in waves, often intermixed with positive memories of the deceased.', 'In major depression, mood and/or interest (pleasure) are decreased for most of two weeks.', 'In grief, self-esteem is usually maintained.', 'In major depression, feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common.', 'In grief, thoughts of death may surface when thinking of or fantasizing about “joining” the deceased loved one.', 'In major depression, thoughts are focused on ending one’s life due to feeling worthless or undeserving of living or being unable to cope with the pain of depression.', 'Grief and depression can co-exist For some people, the death of a loved one, losing a job or being a victim of a physical assault or a major disaster can lead to depression.', 'When grief and depression co-occur, the grief is more severe and lasts longer than grief without depression.', 'Distinguishing between grief and depression is important and can assist people in getting the help, support or treatment they need.', 'Risk Factors for Depression\\n\\nDepression can affect anyone—even a person who appears to live in relatively ideal circumstances.', 'Several factors can play a role in depression:\\n\\nBiochemistry: Differences in certain chemicals in the brain may contribute to symptoms of depression.', 'Differences in certain chemicals in the brain may contribute to symptoms of depression.', 'Genetics: Depression can run in families.', 'For example, if one identical twin has depression, the other has a 70 percent chance of having the illness sometime in life.', 'Depression can run in families.', 'For example, if one identical twin has depression, the other has a 70 percent chance of having the illness sometime in life.', 'Personality: People with low self-esteem, who are easily overwhelmed by stress, or who are generally pessimistic appear to be more likely to experience depression.', 'People with low self-esteem, who are easily overwhelmed by stress, or who are generally pessimistic appear to be more likely to experience depression.', 'Environmental factors: Continuous exposure to violence, neglect, abuse or poverty may make some people more vulnerable to depression.', 'How Is Depression Treated?', 'Depression is among the most treatable of mental disorders.', 'Between 80% and 90% percent of people with depression eventually respond well to treatment.', 'Almost all patients gain some relief from their symptoms.', 'Before a diagnosis or treatment, a health professional should conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including an interview and a physical examination.', 'In some cases, a blood test might be done to make sure the depression is not due to a medical condition like a thyroid problem or a vitamin deficiency (reversing the medical cause would alleviate the depression-like symptoms).', 'The evaluation will identify specific symptoms and explore medical and family histories as well as cultural and environmental factors with the goal of arriving at a diagnosis and planning a course of action.', 'Medication: Brain chemistry may contribute to an individual’s depression and may factor into their treatment.', 'For this reason, antidepressants might be prescribed to help modify one’s brain chemistry.', 'These medications are not sedatives, “uppers” or tranquilizers.', 'They are not habit-forming.', 'Generally antidepressant medications have no stimulating effect on people not experiencing depression.', 'Antidepressants may produce some improvement within the first week or two of use yet full benefits may not be seen for two to three months.', 'If a patient feels little or no improvement after several weeks, his or her psychiatrist can alter the dose of the medication or add or substitute another antidepressant.', 'In some situations other psychotropic medications may be helpful.', 'It is important to let your doctor know if a medication does not work or if you experience side effects.', 'Psychiatrists usually recommend that patients continue to take medication for six or more months after the symptoms have improved.', 'Longer-term maintenance treatment may be suggested to decrease the risk of future episodes for certain people at high risk.', 'Psychotherapy: Psychotherapy, or “talk therapy,” is sometimes used alone for treatment of mild depression; for moderate to severe depression, psychotherapy is often used along with antidepressant medications.', 'Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been found to be effective in treating depression.', 'CBT is a form of therapy focused on the problem solving in the present.', 'CBT helps a person to recognize distorted/negative thinking with the goal of changing thoughts and behaviors to respond to challenges in a more positive manner.', 'Psychotherapy may involve only the individual, but it can include others.', 'For example, family or couples therapy can help address issues within these close relationships.', 'Group therapy brings people with similar illnesses together in a supportive environment, and can assist the participant to learn how others cope in similar situations .', '.Depending on the severity of the depression, treatment can take a few weeks or much longer.', 'In many cases, significant improvement can be made in 10 to 15 sessions.', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) is a medical treatment that has been most commonly reserved for patients with severe major depression who have not responded to other treatments.', 'It involves a brief electrical stimulation of the brain while the patient is under anesthesia.', 'A patient typically receives ECT two to three times a week for a total of six to 12 treatments.', 'It is usually managed by a team of trained medical professionals including a psychiatrist, an anesthesiologist and a nurse or physician assistant.', 'ECT has been used since the 1940s, and many years of research have led to major improvements and the recognition of its effectiveness as a mainstream rather than a \"last resort\" treatment.', '.', 'Self-help and Coping\\n\\nThere are a number of things people can do to help reduce the symptoms of depression.', 'For many people, regular exercise helps create positive feeling and improves mood.', 'Getting enough quality sleep on a regular basis, eating a healthy diet and avoiding alcohol (a depressant) can also help reduce symptoms of depression.', 'Depression is a real illness and help is available.', 'With proper diagnosis and treatment, the vast majority of people with depression will overcome it.', 'If you are experiencing symptoms of depression, a first step is to see your family physician or psychiatrist.', 'Talk about your concerns and request a thorough evaluation.', 'This is a start to addressing your mental health needs.', 'Related Conditions\\n\\nPremenstrual Dysphoric Disorder\\n\\nPremenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) was added to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) in 2013.', 'A woman with PMDD has severe symptoms of depression, irritability, and tension about a week before menstruation begins.', 'Common symptoms include mood swings, irritability or anger, depressed mood, and marked anxiety or tension.', 'Other symptoms may include decreased interest in usual activities, difficulty concentrating, lack of energy or easy fatigue, changes in appetite with specific food cravings, trouble sleeping or sleeping too much, or a sense of being overwhelmed or out of control.', 'Physical symptoms may include breast tenderness or swelling, joint or muscle pain, a sensation of “bloating,” or weight gain.', 'These symptoms begin a week to 10 days before the start of menstruation and improve or stop around the onset of menses.', 'The symptoms lead to significant distress and problems with regular functioning or social interactions.', 'For a diagnosis of PMDD, symptoms must have occurred in most of the menstrual cycles during the past year and must have an adverse effect on work or social functioning.', 'Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is estimated to affect between 1.8% to 5.8% of menstruating women every year.', 'PMDD can be treated with antidepressants, birth control pills, or nutritional supplements.', 'Diet and lifestyle changes, such as reducing caffeine and alcohol, getting enough sleep and exercise, and practicing relaxations techniques, can help.', 'Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is similar to PMDD in that symptoms occur seven to 10 days before a woman’s period begins.', 'However, PMS involves fewer and less severe symptoms than PMDD.', 'Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder\\n\\nDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder is a condition that occurs in children and youth ages 6 to 18.', 'It involves a chronic and severe irritability resulting in severe and frequent temper outbursts.', 'The temper outbursts can be verbal or can involve behavior such as physical aggression toward people or property.', 'These outbursts are significantly out of proportion to the situation and are not consistent with the child’s developmental age.', 'They must occur frequently (three or more times per week on average) and typically in response to frustration.', 'In between the outbursts, the child’s mood is persistently irritable or angry most of the day, nearly every day.', 'This mood is noticeable by others, such as parents, teachers, and peers.', 'In order for a diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder to be made, symptoms must be present for at least one year in at least two settings (such as at home, at school, with peers) and the condition must begin before age 10.', 'Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is much more common in males than females.', 'It may occur along with other disorders, including major depressive, attention-deficit/hyperactivity, anxiety, and conduct disorders.', 'Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder can have a significant impact on the child’s ability to function and a significant impact on the family.', 'Chronic, severe irritability and temper outbursts can disrupt family life, make it difficult for the child/youth to make or keep friendships, and cause difficulties at school.', 'Treatment typically involves psychotherapy (cognitive behavior therapy) and/or medications.', 'Persistent Depressive Disorder\\n\\nA person with persistent depressive disorder (previously referred to as dysthymic disorder) has a depressed mood for most of the day, for more days than not, for at least two years.', 'In children and adolescents, the mood can be irritable or depressed, and must continue for at least one year.', 'In addition to depressed mood, symptoms include:\\n\\nPoor appetite or overeating\\n\\nInsomnia or hypersomnia\\n\\nLow energy or fatigue\\n\\nLow self-esteem\\n\\nPoor concentration or difficulty making decisions\\n\\nFeelings of hopelessness\\n\\nPersistent depressive disorder often begins in childhood, adolescence, or early adulthood and affects an estimated 0.5% of adults in the United States every year.', 'Individuals with persistent depressive disorder often describe their mood as sad or “down in the dumps.” Because these symptoms have become a part of the individual’s day-to-day experience, they may not seek help, just assuming that “I’ve always been this way.”\\n\\nThe symptoms cause significant distress or difficulty in work, social activities, or other important areas of functioning.', 'While the impact of persistent depressive disorder on work, relationships and daily life can vary widely, its effects can be as great as or greater than those of major depressive disorder.', 'A major depressive episode may precede the onset of persistent depressive disorder but may also arise during (and be superimposed on) a previous diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder.', 'References\\n\\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), Fifth
